## Why the name change?

Well, we always knew the domain we wanted to own for this site was taken by someone else... it just wasn't being used for a website. That is.. until some number of months ago!

The once dark website requesting offers/negotiations for purchase suddenly flipped on and is now representing a luxury cruise service.

So we opted to get over the name and pick a new one - this time, one we could acquire the core domain name for.
